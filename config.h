 * contribution of throughput to the performance index. Once the
 * students surpass the AVG_LIBC_THRUPUT, they get no further benefit
 * to their score.  This deters students from building extremely fast,
 * but extremely stupid malloc packages.

 *
 * gback: Again updated in Spring 2016 after switching to clock.
 * This is a base line for a single-threaded implementation, without
 * locking overhead, when clock() is used to time it.
 * This is not meaningful for the multi-threaded implementation
